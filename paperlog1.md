## Summary
Patients who go through knee surgery need to log their pain. More accurate pain logging means that the hospital staff can administer more effective treatments. Often, a nurse does the pain logging, which takes time and effort. You might think that a tablet or smartphone-based pain logging solution would be best for this, but this paper shows how a very basic tangible ten-digit phonepad device (called the Painpad) fits the requirements of hospital-grade durability and learnability. The authors find that pain ratings are higher on the Painpad than logged by the nurses, and speculate that the device gets at a truer rating of pain due to social displays of stoicism, wanting to reduce the nurses's workload, etc. 

## Evaluation
The dead-simple interface seems easy to learn, but it seems like there's more to be done on designing the audio notifications, buttons, and contextual use. I want more iteration within the same requirements of dead-simple tangible devices (e.g., I suspect that the 3x4 grid of buttons might be a little more difficult to reason about than, say, something in a single line). However, the paper nicely illustrates the process of designing tangibles for hospital use cases, and shows the value of using dedicated smart tangibles over other smart devices such as phones, tablets, etc.

## Summary

Parents like to track their baby's data --- imagine feeding times, sleeping duration, amount fed. This team built an integrated data collection station of beautiful tangible devices (push buttons, switches, sliders, video recorders, etc.) and investigated how the devices could facilitate both parents and health care professionals interacting with the data. This was essentially a co-design project, where the team updated the devices and data visualizations according to the needs of the parents and health care professionals. 

## Evaluation
Before I saw the presentation for this paper, I saw the demo and was impressed at the physical design, but extremely unimpressed at the concept. At first glance, it seems like the authors are presenting yet another system of smart devices. However, seeing the presentation and reading that paper makes it clear that the authors are approaching this work with humility and are able to gain great insights. The key is that the study is not about the devices themselves (although they feature heavily), it's about what the devices facilitate: engaging directly with your child's biometrics as a form of care, publicizing this data collection, and engaging health care professionals. 

Critically, the authors are also careful about not over-stating what the devices are good for. For example, they are very clear that health care professionals do not want too much or irrelevant data. A great quote is from a practitioner who has a rule about only *responding* to parent questions, never volunteering insights from the data. The paper is full of these device-specific but still quite interesting design lessons that feel like they give insight to more than what is presented.

This paper is worth a full read if you want to know more about careful co-design, health care design, in-situ work, or faithfully engaging stakeholders.
